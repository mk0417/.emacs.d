  "Alist of desired typeface properties.
The car of each cons cell is an arbitrary key that broadly
describes the display type.  We use 'laptop', 'desktop' though
any symbol will do, e.g. 'video'.
The cdr is a plist that specifies the typographic properties of
fixed-pitch and variable-pitch fonts.  A few notes about those
properties:
- We specify typographic properties both for the `fixed-pitch'
  and `variable-pitch' faces.  This allows us to be explicit
  about all font families that may be used by the active
  theme (Modus themes) under various circumstances (e.g. enabling
  `variable-pitch' for the UI, or using `variable-pitch-mode').
- A semibold weight can only be used by font families that have
  one.  Otherwise it is better to specify bold, in order to avoid
  any potential unpredictable behaviour.
- Never set the :variable-pitch-height to an absolute number
  because that will break the layout of `text-scale-adjust'.  Use
  a floating point instead, so that when the text scale is
  adjusted those expand or contract accordingly.
- An absolute height is only need for the `default' face, which
  we here designated as a fixed-pitch typeface (so the faces
  `fixed-pitch' and `default' share the same font family, though
  their role remains distinct).
- The line height applies to the entirety of the Emacs session.
  We declare it as :fixed-pitch-line-spacing because the face
  `default' starts with a fixed-pitch font family.
- No tests are performed to determined the presence of the font
  families specified herein.  It is assumed that those always
  exist.
It is recommended that the order of the cons cells follows from
the smallest to largest font heights, to simplify the process of
identifying the set that belongs to the small and larger display
respectively (see code of `prot-fonts-laptop-desktop-keys')."
